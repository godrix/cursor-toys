## 🌐 HTTP Request Execution

**Test APIs without leaving your editor.** Execute HTTP requests directly from your workspace with full syntax highlighting, automatic response formatting, and performance tracking.

### Visual Demo
![Send HTTP Request](.github/assets/send-request.gif)

### Creating HTTP Request Files

**Important**: HTTP request files must be located in the `.cursor/http/` folder (or subfolders within it) to be recognized by the extension.

Create files with `.req` or `.request` extension in `.cursor/http/` containing your HTTP requests in one of two formats:

#### Format 1: Curl Command
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer token123" \
  -d '{"name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com"}'
```

#### Format 2: Structured JSON
```json
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://api.example.com/users",
  "headers": {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "Authorization": "Bearer token123"
  },
  "body": {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
}
```

### Executing Requests

#### Method 1: CodeLens (Recommended)
1. Open any `.req` or `.request` file in `.cursor/http/` folder
2. Click the **"Send Request"** link that appears above the request (or above each section if you have multiple requests)
3. The request will be executed and the response will be displayed

#### Method 2: Command Palette
1. Open any `.req` or `.request` file in `.cursor/http/` folder
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux)
3. Type **"CursorToys: Send HTTP Request"** and select it
4. The request will be executed

**Note**: Files must be in `.cursor/http/` (or subfolders) to be recognized. The extension will not show CodeLens links for `.req` files outside this folder.

### Multiple Requests in One File

You can organize multiple requests in a single file using markdown sections. Create the file in `.cursor/http/`:

```markdown
## Get User
curl -X GET https://api.example.com/users/123 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer token123"

## Create User
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer token123" \
  -d '{"name": "John Doe"}'
```

Each section will have its own "Send Request" CodeLens link, allowing you to execute requests individually.

### File Location Requirements

**HTTP request files must be located in:**
- `.cursor/http/` (root level)
- `.cursor/http/subfolder/` (any subfolder)

**Supported file extensions:**
- `.req`
- `.request`

**Example file structure:**
```
project/
  .cursor/
    http/
      api-tests.req
      auth/
        login.request
      users.req
```

### Response Files

When a request is executed:
- **If `httpRequestSaveFile` is `true`**: The response is saved to a `.res` or `.response` file (same name as request file, with response extension)
- **If `httpRequestSaveFile` is `false`**: The response is shown in a preview tab (not saved to disk)

Response files include:
- HTTP status code and status text
- Response headers
- Formatted response body (JSON and XML are automatically formatted)
- Execution time in the file name/title

### Configuration

Configure HTTP request behavior in your settings:

```json
{
  "cursorToys.httpRequestTimeout": 10,
  "cursorToys.httpRequestSaveFile": false
}
```

- **`cursorToys.httpRequestTimeout`**: Timeout in seconds for HTTP requests (default: 10 seconds)
- **`cursorToys.httpRequestSaveFile`**: Save HTTP response to file. If `false`, only shows preview without saving (default: `false`)

### Requirements

- **curl**: The extension uses `curl` command-line tool to execute requests. Make sure `curl` is installed and available in your system PATH.

## 📓 Project Notepads

**Document your project directly in your workspace** — Project-specific markdown notes that stay with your code.

### What are Project Notepads?

Project Notepads are workspace-specific markdown notes stored in `.cursor/notepads/` (or `.vscode/notepads/` if you've configured a different base folder). Unlike Personal Commands/Prompts that are available across all projects, notepads are tied to the current workspace.

**Perfect for:**
- 📋 Project documentation
- 🏗️ Architecture decisions
- 📝 Development guides
- 🐛 Bug investigation notes
- 💡 Feature planning
- 📖 Onboarding documentation

### Creating and Managing Notepads

## 🔗 Link Formats & Distribution

Choose the link format that works best for your sharing needs:

| Format | Example | Best For | Size Limit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deeplink** | `cursor://godrix.cursor-toys/prompt?text=...` | Direct sharing in Slack, Discord, or other tools that support native links | 8,000 chars (URL-encoded) |
| **Web Link** | `https://cursor.com/link/prompt?text=...` | Blogs, documentation, forums, or any platform requiring HTTP links | 8,000 chars (URL-encoded) |
| **CursorToys** | `cursortoys://PROMPT:name:compressedData` | Large files, team sharing, internal distribution | No limit (compressed) |
| **Custom** | `https://example.com/link/prompt?text=...` | Internal systems, custom distribution channels, or branded sharing | 8,000 chars (URL-encoded) |

### CursorToys Format (New in v1.1)

The **CursorToys format** uses gzip compression and base64 encoding to overcome URL length limitations:

**Format Structure:**
```
cursortoys://TYPE:filename:compressedData
```

**Example:**
```
cursortoys://COMMAND:code-review:H4sIAAAAAAAAA...
```

**Features:**
- 📦 **Compressed** — Reduces size by 60-80% using gzip
- ⚡ **Fast** — Smaller payloads mean faster sharing
- 🚫 **No Limits** — No URL length restrictions
- 🔒 **Safe** — Base64 encoding ensures compatibility

**How to Use:**
1. Right-click any command/rule/prompt file
2. Choose **"Share as CursorToys"** instead of "Share as Deeplink"
3. Share the `cursortoys://` link
4. Recipients import with `Cmd+Shift+I` (works automatically)

**Comparison:**

| Metric | Deeplink | CursorToys |
|:-------|:---------|:-----------|
| **Size (1KB file)** | ~1,400 chars | ~600 chars |
| **Size (5KB file)** | ~7,000 chars | ~2,000 chars |
| **Size (10KB file)** | ❌ Exceeds limit | ~3,500 chars |
| **Compression** | None | 60-80% |
| **Import Speed** | Fast | Faster |

## 🔄 VS Code Compatibility

CursorToys is fully compatible with VS Code, but some Cursor-specific features have limitations:

### ✅ Features That Work Fully in VS Code

- **Personal Commands/Prompts Management** — Full library management with tree view
- **In-Editor API Testing** — Complete HTTP request testing with environment variables
- **File Minification** — All minification features work identically
- **Clipboard Processing** — Smart clipboard optimization
- **Web-Based Sharing Links** — Use `https://cursor.com/link/` format
- **Custom Base Folder** — Configure any folder name (e.g., `.vscode`, `.ai`)

### ⚠️ Features With Limitations in VS Code

#### Deeplinks (`cursor://`)
**Limitation:** Native `cursor://` protocol links do not open automatically in VS Code (clicking won't trigger the extension).

**Workaround:** Deeplinks still work, but require manual import:
1. Copy the `cursor://` deeplink
2. Open Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`)
3. Run **"CursorToys: Import Share Link"** (or use shortcut `Cmd+Shift+I` / `Ctrl+Shift+I`)
4. Paste the deeplink when prompted
5. File will be created successfully

**Alternative:** Configure link type to web for better sharing:
```json
{
  "cursorToys.linkType": "web"
}
```

#### Send to Chat
**Limitation:** Commands that send text to Cursor's AI chat won't work (no chat in VS Code).

**Workaround:** Manually copy the generated content and use it in a compatible chat interface or AI tool.

#### Rules and Prompts
**Limitation:** Rules and prompts are Cursor-specific features that may not work in VS Code.

**Note:** These features use the configured base folder, but their functionality depends on Cursor AI's architecture. They work for organization and sharing, but won't have the same behavior in VS Code as in Cursor IDE.

### 🚀 Using CursorToys with VS Code

1. **Install the extension** normally from VS Code Marketplace
2. **Configure base folder** in settings:
   ```json
   {
     "cursorToys.baseFolder": "vscode"
   }
   ```
3. **Set link type** to web:
   ```json
   {
     "cursorToys.linkType": "web"
   }
   ```
4. **All file management and API testing features work perfectly!**

> **Note:** The `baseFolder` setting applies to all resources (commands, rules, prompts, HTTP). Rules and prompts are Cursor AI-specific features - they'll be stored in your configured folder but may not have full functionality outside of Cursor IDE.

## 💡 Real-World Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Team Onboarding
**Problem**: New team members need to set up Cursor with project-specific commands and rules.

**Solution**: 
1. Team lead creates standardized commands and rules
2. Generates deeplinks for each configuration
3. Shares links in onboarding documentation
4. New members import everything with `Cmd+Shift+I` in seconds

**Result**: Consistent AI behavior across the entire team from day one.

### Use Case 2: API Development Workflow
**Problem**: Constantly switching between editor and terminal/Postman to test API endpoints.

**Solution**:
1. Create `.req` files in `.cursor/http/` folder (or subfolders)
2. Set up environment variables in `.cursor/http/environments/`
3. Use `{{VARIABLE}}` syntax for dynamic values
4. Execute directly from editor with CodeLens
5. Switch environments via status bar or command palette
6. View formatted responses with execution times

**Result**: Faster iteration, better context, no context switching. Environment-specific testing without manual value changes.

### Use Case 3: Optimizing Large API Responses
**Problem**: Large JSON responses from APIs take up too much space in chat context.

**Solution**:
1. Copy API response to clipboard
2. Run "Trim & Minify Clipboard" command
3. Paste optimized JSON into Cursor chat
4. More room for actual code and questions

**Result**: Better use of chat context limits, faster AI responses, cleaner conversations.

### Use Case 4: Personal Productivity
**Problem**: Recreating the same commands in every new project.

**Solution**:
1. Build a personal command library using the tree view
2. Save frequently used commands as personal commands
3. Access them instantly in any project
4. Share your best commands with the community

**Result**: Your best AI workflows available everywhere, instantly.

### Use Case 5: Knowledge Sharing
**Problem**: Great AI prompts and commands get lost in Slack/Discord history.

**Solution**:
1. Create a command/prompt that solves a specific problem
2. Generate a shareable deeplink
3. Share in team channels or documentation
4. Team members can import and use immediately

**Result**: Knowledge becomes reusable, searchable, and permanent.

## ⚙️ Configuration & Customization

### Workspace vs User Settings

Configure the extension at both workspace and user levels:

- **Workspace settings**: Project-specific configurations (`.vscode/settings.json`)
- **User settings**: Personal preferences that apply globally

### Recommended Settings

```json
{
  // Use web links for maximum compatibility
  "cursorToys.linkType": "web",
  
  // Save HTTP responses for API testing workflow
  "cursorToys.httpRequestSaveFile": true,
  "cursorToys.httpRequestTimeout": 30,
  "cursorToys.httpDefaultEnvironment": "dev",
  
  // Support both .cursor and .claude folders
  "cursorToys.commandsFolder": "cursor",
  "cursorToys.personalCommandsView": "both",
  
  // Minification settings
  "cursorToys.minify.outputSuffix": ".min"
}
```

## 📝 Limitations & Notes

  * **URL Length Limit**: Deeplink content cannot exceed 8,000 characters (after URL-encoding). The system will warn you if this limit is reached.
  * **File Location for Deeplinks**: Only files within `.cursor/commands/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.cursor/rules/`, or `.cursor/prompts/` folders can be converted into share links.
  * **HTTP Request File Location**: HTTP request files (`.req`, `.request`) must be located in `.cursor/http/` folder (or subfolders) to be recognized and executed.
  * **HTTP Requests**: Requires `curl` to be installed and available in your system PATH.
