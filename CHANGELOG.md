## [1.4.1] - 2026-01-02

### Added

#### 🔄 **Cascading Environment Decorators for HTTP Requests**
- **3-Level Environment Cascading**: Environment decorators now cascade through three levels for better flexibility
  - **Section-specific**: `# @env dev` placed before a section (##) applies only to that section
  - **Previous section inheritance**: Sections without explicit decorator inherit from previous section
  - **Global environment**: `# @env prod` at the top of file applies to all sections without explicit decorator
- **Smart Environment Propagation**: Environment settings cascade down until explicitly changed
  - Reduces repetition - no need to add `# @env` before every section
  - More intuitive behavior - sections inherit parent environment by default
  - Explicit decorators always override inherited values
- **CodeLens Environment Display**: CodeLens now shows environment name only when variables are present
  - Format: `Send Request: Section Title [env]` when section has variables
  - Format: `Send Request: Section Title` when section has no variables
  - Cleaner UI - environment indicator only shown when relevant
- **Standalone cURL Support**: Standalone cURL commands (not in sections) also support cascading
  - Inherits from global environment decorator if present
  - Environment shown in CodeLens only if variables detected
- **Hover Provider Cascading**: Variable hover now uses same 3-level cascading logic
  - Shows correct environment for each variable based on cascade
  - Recursive environment detection for inheritance chain

### Enhanced

#### 🎨 **Syntax Highlighting for HTTP Request Files**
- **Environment Decorator Syntax**: New syntax highlighting for `# @env` decorators
  - `# @env` keyword highlighted as control directive (keyword.control.directive.env)
  - Environment name highlighted as type entity (entity.name.type.env-name)
  - Makes decorators visually distinct from regular comments
- **Variable Syntax Highlighting**: Enhanced highlighting for environment variables
  - `{{variableName}}` pattern now highlighted as environment variable
  - Variable name inside braces highlighted separately (variable.parameter.env-variable)
  - Improves visibility of variables in HTTP request files
- **Comment Support**: Added block comment support (`/* */`) for HTTP request files
  - Block comments properly highlighted as comment.block.http-request
  - Consistent with other language syntax highlighting

### Changed
- **Version**: Bumped from 1.4.0 to 1.4.1
- **Environment Detection Logic**: Refactored environment detection into modular functions
  - `findSectionEnvironment()`: Finds section-specific decorator
  - `findPreviousSectionEnvironment()`: Finds inherited environment from previous section
  - `findGlobalEnvironment()`: Finds global environment at file top
  - `getEnvironmentForSection()`: Orchestrates 3-level cascade
- **HTTP CodeLens Provider**: Updated to support cascading and conditional environment display
  - Detects global environment at file start
  - Initializes section environment with global value
  - Maintains environment state across sections (no reset)
  - Shows environment in title only when variables present
- **HTTP Request Executor**: Updated to use new cascading logic
  - Applies same 3-level environment detection
  - Properly resolves variables using cascaded environment
  - Validates variables against correct environment
- **HTTP Environment Providers**: Enhanced hover and completion providers
  - Hover provider uses recursive cascading logic
  - Shows correct environment name in hover tooltip
  - Suggests available environments in completion

### Technical Details

#### Enhanced Files
- **`src/httpCodeLensProvider.ts`**:
  - Added global environment detection at file start
  - Changed `currentEnv` initialization to use `globalEnv` instead of `null`
  - Removed environment reset when starting new sections (maintains cascade)
  - Added comment explaining inheritance behavior: "DO NOT reset currentEnv - maintain inheritance cascade"
  - Environment inheritance now explicit: `envName: currentEnv // Inherits from previous section or global`
- **`src/httpEnvironmentProviders.ts`**:
  - Refactored `getEnvironmentForLine()` to implement 3-level cascade
  - Added `findSectionEnvironment()`: Section-specific decorator detection
  - Added `findPreviousSectionEnvironment()`: Recursive inheritance from previous section
  - Added `findGlobalEnvironment()`: Global decorator detection at file top
  - Updated decorator search logic to stop at section boundaries or non-comment lines
  - Improved comment handling in environment detection
- **`src/httpRequestExecutor.ts`**:
  - Refactored `getEnvironmentForSection()` to use modular helper functions
  - Added `findSectionEnvironment()`: Section-specific decorator detection
  - Added `findPreviousSectionEnvironment()`: Recursive inheritance detection
  - Added `findGlobalEnvironment()`: Global decorator detection
  - Updated environment detection to support 3-level cascading
  - Consistent behavior with other HTTP environment providers
- **`syntaxes/http-request.tmLanguage.json`**:
  - Added block comment syntax pattern (`/* */`)
  - Added environment decorator pattern (`# @env name`)
  - Added variable pattern highlighting (`{{variableName}}`)
  - Captures for keyword and entity name in decorators
  - Captures for variable parameters

### Use Cases

**Cascading Environments Example:**

```http
# @env prod

## Get All Users
curl --request GET \
  --url {{base_url}}/api/users
  # Uses 'prod' environment (inherited from global)

# @env dev
## Create User
curl --request POST \
  --url {{base_url}}/api/users \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"name": "John"}'
  # Uses 'dev' environment (explicit decorator)

## Update User
curl --request PUT \
  --url {{base_url}}/api/users/1 \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{"name": "Jane"}'
  # Uses 'dev' environment (inherited from previous section)

# @env staging
## Delete User
curl --request DELETE \
  --url {{base_url}}/api/users/1
  # Uses 'staging' environment (explicit decorator)
```

**Benefits:**
1. **Less Repetition**: Set global environment once at the top, override only when needed
2. **Better Organization**: Group related sections with same environment
3. **Clearer Intent**: Explicit decorators show when environment changes
4. **Flexible Workflow**: Mix environments in single file without repetition

## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-01

### Fixed
